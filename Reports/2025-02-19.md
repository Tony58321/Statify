# Team Report
## Goals from Last Week:
- Continue to work on, and hopefully finish, the user interface and any styling of the webpage.
- Finish the functionality for fetching data on users top artists.
- Begin to add variations to the statistics that users can view: changing timeframe and number of tracks/artists.
## Progress and Issues:
Our team made a lot of progress on the user interface, with much of the styling done and top tracks displays. We finished the functionality for fetching top aritist info. We added the time frame and number specifications to top tracks.
## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Implement the display for top artists as well and the changing of time frame or number of artisits displayed.
- Start creating custom themes.
- Design auto testing.

# Contributions of Individual Team Members:
# 1. Aaron Pina-Ramirez:
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Expand the information returned by getTopTracks(), the current goal is to have it return the genres for each of the songs/tracks.
- Continue exploring what other things might be good to return for each track.

## Progress and Issues:
- Have not yet developed the ability of getTopTracks() to return the genre for the returned tracks.
- Fixed broken login button.

## Current Plans and Goals:
- Develop ability of getTopTracks() to return the genre for the returned tracks.

# 2. Antonio Rodriguez :
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- The plan was to work on pulling the top genres from Spotify as well as the comparing to national statistics. For now I think Aaron and I will decide which feature to work on first, which will likely be the top genres!
## Progress and Issues:
- We haven't been able to get the genres for each of the songs mainly due to the homework assignment taking up our group time.
- My role for the week was to get AFL and Delta working on my machine (prior to the email the professor sent) and running through it to get the results for my team. We were able to then get it running on everyones machine and answer the homework questions as a group.
## Current Plans and Goals:
- I believe I want to get started on generating a playlist based on the user's top songs. Ideally, the user can choose the time period from which to generate a playlist.
- Help Aaron with returning the genre for the top tracks.
