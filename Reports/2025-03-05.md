# Team Report
## Goals from Last Week:
- Finalize our automatic test cases and any manual testing that needs to be performed.
- Finish any additional functionality before beta testing on Monday.

## Progress and Issues:
- We have been testing our program manually as we go and have not found any big issues.
- Most of the functionality has been completed. 
- We need to complete the front-end and write more automated tests. 

## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Writing more automated tests and making sure all our features work. 
- Working more on the front-end and our themes.

# 2. Antonio Rodriguez :
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Generating a playlist based on the user's top songs. Ideally, the user can choose the time period from which to generate a playlist.
- Help Aaron with returning the genre for the top tracks.

## Progress and Issues:
- I was able to succesfully implement the generating playlist feature! The user must first get the top tracks for a certain time period, then the button to create a playlist should appear.
- I wasn't able to help Aaron return the genre because we have prioritized comparing the national averages to a user's listening habits.
  
## Current Plans and Goals:
- Update Trello board
- Finish and submit poster
- Help Aaron and Elizabeth with their implementations if needed so we can release our project by Sunday.
