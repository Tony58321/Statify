# Team Report
## Goals from Last Week:
Implement the display for top artists as well and the changing of time frame or number of artisits displayed.
Start creating custom themes.
Design auto testing.
## Progress and Issues:
This week we met to work on creating tests and look at implementing continuous integration. We inititally considered using jest for automated testing, but we quickly realized that it might not be possible to test most of our functionality due to the authorization flow of spotify. After this, we chose to move forward with playwright, which allows more browser-focused testing. We also discussed our different tests in relation to which categories of testing they would fall under.
