# Team Report
## Goals from Last Week:
- Test and debug the login functionality, if any problems arise. 
- Continue work on getting user listening statistics from the API.
- Checking the CSS styles for any accessibility usability issues. 
- Each group member starts work on their individual use case.
## Progress and Issues:
Our team has made a lot of good progress this week including: fetching the top tracks for a specific user and presenting the results, debugging the login functionality, and beginning to style our webpage. An issue that came up is that the API wasn't working for some members in our group. We learned that some group members emails weren't connected to the API, so once we fixed this, it solved this issue. Now, all group members can view their top twenty tracks from the last 6 months of their connected Spotify account.
## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Continue to work on, and hopefully finish, the user interface and any styling of the webpage.
- Finish the functionality for fetching data on users top artists.
- Begin to add variations to the statistics that users can view: changing timeframe and number of tracks/artists.

# Contributions of Individual Team Members:
# 1. Aaron Pina-Ramirez:
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Work more on getTopTracks(), make it so it also returns the image url for the cover art for each track, link to the song. And consider what other things might be good to return for each track as well

## Progress and Issues:
- getTopTracks() now does everything that I had as a goal from the previous week.
- Wrote comprehensive instructions on how to use getTopTracks(), and discussed with frontend team to clarify any questions they had.
- Upon discussing with rest of team, discovered more track info that getTopTracks() should return. 

## Current Plans and Goals:
- Expand the information returned by getTopTracks(), the current goal is to have it return the genres for each of the songs/tracks.
- Continue exploring what other things might be good to return for each track.

# 2. Antonio Rodriguez :
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Finish getting a user's track by getting a link to the song and image of the album.
## Progress and Issues:
- Aaron successfully finished the functionality for getting the top users, however I ran into issues on my end. I had to confirm my email on spotify for the app to work as intended. I was also able to make the project schedule slide for our presentation.
## Current Plans and Goals:
- The current plan is to work on pulling the top genres from Spotify as well as the comparing to national statistics. For now I think Aaron and I will decide which feature to work on first, which will likely be the top genres!
