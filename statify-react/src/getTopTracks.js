/*
getTopTracks() usage tutorial:
The getTopTracks() function takes care of all the work of returning the user's most listened to tracks!
Upon calling this function it will return a array of Track objects (I made a track class) that contains all the essential information, including
the track name, the artists, a link to the track on spotify, and the track cover art in the form of a url.

Call this function in App.jsx (or elsewhere if you find it useful)

The simplest call over in App.jsx will look something like this: topTracks = await getTopTracks(token)
where "topTracks" is just a variable that will hold the aformentioned Track array that getTopTracks returned.
Here is a format for a button as well:           <button onClick={async () =>{ topTracks = await getTopTracks(token)}  }>Get Top Tracks Test</button>

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only calling getTopTracks with "getTopTracks(token)" will grab the top tracks with the default arguments, which is return 20 tracks over the medium time term (past 6 months)
To get more specific, you will want to call it with a "quanity" and "time_range" argument in this format: getTopTracks(token, integer_quantity, time_range_string)
The integer quantity can be a integer value from 0 to 50.
And the time_range can be any of these three strings: 
- "short_term" , which is the past 4 weeks
- "medium_term", which is the past 6 months
- "long_term" , which is the past 1 year

When designing the frontend you'll probably want to implement some sort of input validation for these values because getTopTracks() does not validate input.

export async function getTopTracks(token, onLoad, quantity = 20, time_range =  "medium_term"){


    /*This block of code customizes the api call so we get exactly the stuff we want */
    let apiCallString = "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks"
    apiCallString =  `${apiCallString}?limit=${quantity}`                               //Set number of top tracks to return

    //Set tune range of tracks to return

    //This makes the api call to the Spotify API asking for the user top tracks
    let response = await fetch(apiCallString , {
        method: "GET", headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
    });
    //If there is an error in fetching the data, this if() block will catch it and print error to the console.
    if (!response.ok) {
        console.error("Error fetching top tracks:", response.status, response.statusText);
        return null; // Or throw an error
    }

    //The fetched user top tracks stored in the "response" variable are put in an interpretable JSON format and put inside the tracksJson variable

    //The goal is to store all the top tracks the tracksArray. The array will be filled with Track objects, which contain all the key info about each of the tracks
    //See below for the Track class definition
    let tracksArray = []


    //For() loop iterates through each track returned in the API call. tracksJson.items.length ensures we only go through up to the amount of tracks that were returned
    // tracksJson.limit USED to be the number used, but it causes an issue where if the user requests more tracks then they have listened to, say in the case of a new or rarely used account 
    // it creates an error as it tries to scan for track array items that are not there.
    for( let i = 0 ;i<tracksJson.items.length; i++){

        //currTrackJson holds the particular track we are extracting data for each iteration. In other words currTrackJson represents 1 track at any given moment
        
        let currTrackJson = tracksJson.items[i]
        console.log(currTrackJson);

        //console.log(currTrackJson.artists)
        //This block extracts the artist names from the current track, This is needed as each track may have more than one artist 
        let artistArr = []
        for(let j = 0; j < currTrackJson.artists.length; j++){
            artistArr.push(currTrackJson.artists[j].name)
        }

        let imageUrl = currTrackJson.album.images[0].url

        //Finally, we can create our Track object for this particular track
        let trackToInsert = new Track(currTrackJson.name,artistArr , imageUrl , currTrackJson.external_urls.spotify,currTrackJson.id )
        //and insert the track object into the track array
        tracksArray.push(trackToInsert)

    }
